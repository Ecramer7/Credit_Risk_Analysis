# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning skills to evaluate models with unbalanced classes in credit. Due to fact that credit risk is inherently an unbalanced classification problem, different techniques were needed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

## Results

The two evaluation methods used were ensemble learning and re-sampling. 

## Summary 

With our data, the Easy Ensemble Model performed the most accurately. This is the model type that should be used going forward.
